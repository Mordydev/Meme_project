# Task 1: Project Repository & Version Control Setup

## Task Overview
Establish the fundamental project repository structure, version control practices, and documentation framework that will support the entire development lifecycle. This task creates the organizational foundation that will enable efficient collaboration and maintain architectural integrity throughout all phases.

## Required Document Review
- **Frontend & Backend Guidelines** - Focus on section 3 (Code Organization) for directory structure and naming conventions
- **App Flow Document** - Review section 9 (Governance & Evolution) for documentation standards
- **Masterplan Document** - Review section 5.1 (Architecture Overview) for component structure

## Key Architectural Decisions

### Project Repository Structure
**Options Considered:**
1. Monorepo approach with all components in a single repository
2. Multiple repositories separated by frontend/backend
3. Multiple repositories separated by feature domains

**Recommended Approach:** Monorepo using Turborepo or similar tool

**Rationale:** 
- Simplifies version management across interconnected components
- Enables atomic commits across frontend and backend changes
- Facilitates shared component libraries and utilities
- Supports the phased development approach with clearer dependency tracking
- Better aligns with the integrated JAMstack architecture described in the documents

### Branch Strategy
**Options Considered:**
1. GitHub Flow (feature branches + main)
2. GitFlow (development, feature, release, hotfix branches)
3. Trunk-based development with feature flags

**Recommended Approach:** GitHub Flow with protected main branch

**Rationale:**
- Simpler workflow appropriate for the team size and project timeline
- Continuous integration approach aligns with rapid development goals
- Clear process for feature development and review
- Lower overhead compared to GitFlow
- Protects production code while enabling continuous delivery

## Implementation Sub-Tasks

### Sub-Task 1: Repository Initialization
**Description:** Create and configure the base repository with appropriate structure and initial configuration files.

```

**Key Code Elements:**
```json
// package.json
{
  "name": "success-kid-platform",
  "version": "0.1.0",
  "private": true,
  "workspaces": [
    "apps/*",
    "packages/*"
  ],
  "scripts": {
    "build": "turbo run build",
    "dev": "turbo run dev",
    "lint": "turbo run lint",
    "test": "turbo run test",
    "format": "prettier --write \"**/*.{ts,tsx,md}\""
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "prettier": "^2.8.8",
    "turbo": "^1.10.0"
  }
}
```

```json
// turbo.json
{
  "$schema": "https://turbo.build/schema.json",
  "pipeline": {
    "build": {
      "dependsOn": ["^build"],
      "outputs": ["dist/**", ".next/**", "!.next/cache/**"]
    },
    "dev": {
      "cache": false,
      "persistent": true
    },
    "lint": {},
    "test": {
      "dependsOn": ["build"],
      "inputs": ["src/**/*.tsx", "src/**/*.ts", "test/**/*.ts", "test/**/*.tsx"]
    }
  }
}
```

**Best Practices:**
- Configure .gitignore to exclude environment-specific files, build artifacts, and dependency directories
- Set up GitHub repository with branch protection rules for main branch
- Include clear documentation on repository structure and contribution workflow
- Add issue and pull request templates to standardize team communication
- Set up commit message conventions (e.g., Conventional Commits)

**Potential Challenges:**
- **Monorepo Complexity:** If team members are unfamiliar with monorepo structure, provide additional documentation
- **Dependency Management:** Monitor workspace dependency management to prevent circular dependencies

### Sub-Task 2: Documentation Framework
**Description:** Establish a comprehensive documentation structure that will support all phases of development.

**Implementation Guide:**
```

## Development Workflow

[Describe branch strategy, PR process, and deployment workflow]
```

**Best Practices:**
- Use Markdown for all documentation for consistency and GitHub integration
- Set up automated documentation updates for API changes
- Reference external design documents but maintain implementation details in-repo
- Include diagrams for complex architectural concepts
- Maintain a changelog to track significant changes

**Potential Challenges:**
- **Documentation Drift:** Schedule regular documentation reviews to prevent outdated information
- **Adoption by Team:** Encourage documentation contributions as part of definition of done for features

### Sub-Task 3: Branch Workflow Configuration
**Description:** Implement the chosen branch strategy with appropriate protection rules and automation.

**Implementation Guide:**
```
# Branch Structure
- main             # Production-ready code
- feature/*        # Feature branches (e.g., feature/wallet-integration)
- bugfix/*         # Bug fix branches
- hotfix/*         # Urgent production fixes
```

**GitHub Branch Protection Rules:**
- Require pull request reviews before merging to main
- Require status checks to pass before merging
- Require linear history
- Do not allow force pushes to main
- Automatically delete head branches after merging

**Key Code Elements:**
```yaml
# .github/workflows/pr-checks.yml
name: Pull Request Checks

on:
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  validate:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Use Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: '18'
          cache: 'npm'
      - run: npm ci
      - run: npm run lint
      - run: npm run test
      - run: npm run build
```

**Best Practices:**
- Create a CONTRIBUTING.md file to document the branch workflow
- Set up PR templates that include checklists for quality standards
- Configure automated CI checks for all pull requests
- Include code owners file to automatically request reviews from appropriate team members
- Implement Husky pre-commit hooks for code quality checks

**Potential Challenges:**
- **Complex Merges:** Encourage frequent small PRs rather than large changes
- **CI Performance:** Optimize test runs to prevent long waits during PR review process

## Integration Points
- Connects with all subsequent tasks as the foundation for code management
- Requires coordination with the CI/CD Pipeline task for workflow integration
- Branch strategy impacts release management in future phases

## Testing & Validation
- Verify repository cloning and setup process with new team members
- Test PR workflow with sample feature branch
- Validate branch protection rules by attempting to bypass them
- Ensure CI checks properly identify failing tests or linting issues
