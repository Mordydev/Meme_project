## 8. Risk Assessment

### 8.1 Prioritized Risks

| Risk | Impact | Probability | Risk Level | Mitigation Strategy |
|------|--------|------------|------------|---------------------|
| **Token price volatility affecting community sentiment** | High | High | **Critical** | Design price-independent value features; emphasize community aspects; celebrate both up and down movements |
| **Rapid user growth overwhelming infrastructure** | High | Medium | **High** | Design for scalability from start; implement auto-scaling; monitor closely; have on-call team during growth spikes |
| **Content moderation challenges with growing community** | Medium | High | **High** | Develop robust moderation tools; establish clear community guidelines; train community moderators |
| **API rate limits or outages affecting market data** | Medium | Medium | **Medium** | Implement multiple data sources with fallbacks; cache data appropriately; degrade gracefully |
| **Technical debt accumulation due to rapid development** | Medium | High | **Medium** | Schedule regular refactoring periods; maintain code quality standards; document technical decisions |
| **Competitor platforms drawing away community** | High | Medium | **Medium** | Focus on unique value proposition; maintain rapid feature development; foster strong community bonds |
| **Security vulnerabilities in wallet connection** | High | Low | **Medium** | Thorough security testing; limit scope of wallet integration; follow blockchain security best practices |
| **Regulatory changes affecting crypto communities** | Medium | Low | **Low** | Stay informed of regulations; maintain compliance; design for adaptability; include disclaimers |
