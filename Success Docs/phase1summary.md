### Frontend Architecture
- **Component Pattern:** Atomic Design with TypeScript interfaces
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS with design system tokens
- **State Management:** Domain-specific approach with React Query and Zustand
- **Routing:** React Router with layout patterns
- **Build System:** Vite with optimized configuration

### Backend Architecture
- **Database:** PostgreSQL via Supabase
- **API Access:** Supabase direct access with Row Level Security
- **Custom Logic:** Edge Functions for complex operations
- **Realtime:** Supabase Realtime subscriptions
- **Storage:** Supabase Storage for media content

### Authentication System
- **Multi-provider Auth:** Clerk integration
- **Wallet Integration:** Phantom wallet connection
- **Security Model:** Role-based permissions with Row Level Security
- **Session Management:** JWT tokens with secure handling

## Key Decisions Made

| Decision Area | Selected Approach | Rationale |
|---------------|-------------------|-----------|
| Repository Structure | Monorepo with Turborepo | Unified versioning, shared code, simplified dependency management |
| Branch Strategy | GitHub Flow | Simpler workflow suited to team size, continuous integration support |
| Frontend Framework | Vite with React & TypeScript | Faster development, optimized builds, type safety |
| CSS Approach | Tailwind CSS | Rapid development, design system consistency, performance optimization |
| State Management | Domain-specific (React Query + Zustand) | Right tool for each state type, optimized for different data patterns |
| Database Schema | Hybrid relational with selective denormalization | Balance between relational integrity and query performance |
| API Pattern | Supabase direct + custom Edge Functions | Reduced boilerplate, strong security, flexible customization where needed |
| Authentication | Clerk + Phantom Wallet | Multi-provider support, specialized wallet integration |
