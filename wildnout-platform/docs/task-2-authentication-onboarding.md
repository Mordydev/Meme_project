# Task 2: Authentication & User Onboarding

## Implementation Summary

This task involved implementing the authentication flow and first-time user experience for the Wild 'n Out platform. The implementation follows the required user experience flow:

1. New user arrives → Registration options presented → User registers → Onboarding flow → Platform introduction
2. Returning user arrives → Login form presented → Credentials validated → Previous session restored

## Implemented Components

### Authentication Components
- Sign-in page with Clerk integration
- Sign-up page with Clerk integration
- Password recovery page
- Authentication callback handler
- Authentication layout for consistent styling

### Onboarding Flow
- Multi-step onboarding process with:
  - Welcome introduction
  - Profile setup (name, bio, interests)
  - Feature highlights/platform introduction
  - Battle system introduction
  - Completion summary

### Authentication Middleware
- Route protection using Clerk middleware
- Public routes configuration
- Authentication state management

### API Integration
- Profile data persistence using backend API
- Server actions for onboarding data
- Clerk webhook handler for authentication events

## Technical Implementation

### Authentication Flow
- Used Clerk's pre-built components with custom styling
- Implemented proper routing and redirects
- Created authentication provider for the entire application
- Added authentication hooks for easy access to auth state

### Onboarding Experience
- Created a multi-step flow with progress tracking
- Implemented state persistence between steps
- Added validation for user inputs
- Connected to backend for profile data storage

### State Management
- Local state for onboarding progress
- API integration for persistent data storage
- Loading states for asynchronous operations

## Design Considerations
- Mobile-first design for all components
- Consistent Wild 'n Out branding
- Accessible forms and navigation
- Proper loading and error states

## Testing
- Authentication flow verification
- Form validation testing
- State persistence checks
- Error handling verification

## Future Improvements
- Enhanced social login options
- More robust error handling
- Analytics integration
- Improved personalization based on onboarding data
